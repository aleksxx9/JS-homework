Firstly in order this application to work you will need to navigate to .env_sample folder and put API key values instead of your_API_key and your_API_secret.

Starting server:
Once API keys are set you will need to open command prompt and navigate to Backend folder (i.e. C:/Users/.../JS_homework/Backend/) once there write following commands: npm install. When loading finishes write node server.js

Starting frontend:
To run frontend you can open it with visual studio code and run with live server or by coppying frontend path and pasting it in the browser (i.e. C:/Users/.../JS_homework/Frontend/index.html)
